    `vars` is required and must contain at least one variable in `data`.

---

    `v` must be a single positive integer greater than 1.

---

    The number of rows is less than `v` = 500.

---

    `cluster_function` must be one of "kmeans" or "hclust", not "not an option".

---

    Code
      clustering_cv(Orange, v = 1, vars = "Tree")
    Condition
      Error in `clustering_cv()`:
      ! `v` must be a single positive integer greater than 1.

---

    `repeats` must be a single positive integer.

---

    `repeats` must be a single positive integer.

    Code
      clustering_cv(mtcars, mpg, v = nrow(mtcars))
    Condition
      Error in `clustering_cv()`:
      ! Leave-one-out cross-validation is not supported by this function.
      x You set `v` to `nrow(data)`, which would result in a leave-one-out cross-validation.
      i Use `loo_cv()` in this case.
